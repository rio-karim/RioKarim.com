            <p class="mb-3">
              Since I began my career 4 years ago I have built and collaborated
              on open-source projects, microservices front-to-back, and designed
              several great websites.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              In 2016 I went to
              <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science"
                >Cardiff University</a
              >
              to graduate from post-graduate Computer Science, where I learned a
              variety of languages - including Java, Assembly, Python and
              JavaScript. Following the support, communication and collaboration
              of fellow graduates, I began working in a startup with some of my
              university alumni. In those 6 months we built, marketed and
              launched a CRM SaaS service called
              <a href="https://datalyse.io/en/" target="_blank">Datalyse</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              I then began working as a freelancer and contractor for several
              clients and companies in the
              <a
                href="https://www.business.natwest.com/business/business-services/entrepreneur-accelerator.html"
                >Natwest Entrepreneur Accelerator</a
              >
              at Cardiff's Central Square. Being self-employed for a year, and
              having collaborated and worked solo on multiple CRM systems and
              frontends, I then began working for
              <a href="https://pilltime.co.uk/">PillTime (Online Pharmacy)</a>,
              using a mixture of Laravel and JavaScript supporting their
              internal operations, and NHS guidelines.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              In early 2019, I then moved with my CTO to work at another online
              pharmacy
              <a href="https://www.instantecare.co.uk/">Instant eCare (IEC)</a>,
              working with Express, Nuxt, and Magento to build frontends and
              backend services to support their sales and operations. Following
              changes to pharmacy regulations, in 2020 I have since moved
              towards a more Data Science centric roll as a Full-stack
              developer, working on ethical data services for
              <a href="https://2132.io/">21:32</a> - working with clients such
              as McDonalds, Starbucks and other huge franchises.
